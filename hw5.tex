\begin{document}
\paragraph{Problem 1} Use a reduction to show that the language $ALL_{TM}$ is undecidable
\[ALL_{TM} = \{ \langle M \rangle \;|\; \mbox{where $M$ is a TM and $L(M) = \Sigma*$} \}\]

\paragraph{Problem 2} A {\em useless state} in a Turing machine
is one that is never entered on any input string.  Consider the 
problem of determining whether a Turing Machine has any useless 
states.  Formulate this problem as a language and show that it 
is undecidable.

\paragraph{Problem 3} If $A \leq_m B$ and $B$ is a regular language,
does this imply that $A$ is a regular language? Why or why not?

\paragraph{Problem 4} Prove that the language
\[ LOOP_{TM} = \{ \langle M \rangle \;|\; M \text{ is a TM and $M$ loops on all inputs} \} \]
is not recognizable.

\paragraph{Problem 5} Prove that the 3-SAT problem discussed in class is an element of $NP$ by
giving a verifier and a NTM decider that run in poly-time.
